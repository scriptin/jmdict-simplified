<!ELEMENT entry (ent_seq, k_ele*, r_ele+, sense+)>
	<!-- Entries consist of kanji elements, reading elements, 
	general information and sense elements. Each entry must have at 
	least one reading element and one sense element. Others are optional.
	-->
<!ELEMENT ent_seq (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- A unique numeric sequence number for each entry
	-->
<!ELEMENT k_ele (keb, ke_inf*, ke_pri*)>
	<!-- The kanji element, or in its absence, the reading element, is 
	the defining component of each entry.
	The overwhelming majority of entries will have a single kanji
	element associated with a word in Japanese. Where there are 
	multiple kanji elements within an entry, they will be orthographical
	variants of the same word, either using variations in okurigana, or
	alternative and equivalent kanji. Common "mis-spellings" may be 
	included, provided they are associated with appropriate information
	fields. Synonyms are not included; they may be indicated in the
	cross-reference field associated with the sense element.
	-->
<!ELEMENT keb (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- This element will contain a word or short phrase in Japanese 
	which is written using at least one non-kana character (usually kanji,
	but can be other characters). The valid characters are
	kanji, kana, related characters such as chouon and kurikaeshi, and
	in exceptional cases, letters from other alphabets.
	-->
<!ELEMENT ke_inf (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- This is a coded information field related specifically to the 
	orthography of the keb, and will typically indicate some unusual
	aspect, such as okurigana irregularity.
	-->
<!ELEMENT ke_pri (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- This and the equivalent re_pri field are provided to record
	information about the relative priority of the entry,  and consist
	of codes indicating the word appears in various references which
	can be taken as an indication of the frequency with which the word
	is used. This field is intended for use either by applications which 
	want to concentrate on entries of  a particular priority, or to 
	generate subset files. 
	The current values in this field are:
	- news1/2: appears in the "wordfreq" file compiled by Alexandre Girardi
	from the Mainichi Shimbun. (See the Monash ftp archive for a copy.)
	Words in the first 12,000 in that file are marked "news1" and words 
	in the second 12,000 are marked "news2".
	- ichi1/2: appears in the "Ichimango goi bunruishuu", Senmon Kyouiku 
	Publishing, Tokyo, 1998.  (The entries marked "ichi2" were
	demoted from ichi1 because they were observed to have low
	frequencies in the WWW and newspapers.)
	- spec1 and spec2: a small number of words use this marker when they 
	are detected as being common, but are not included in other lists.
	- gai1/2: common loanwords, based on the wordfreq file.
	- nfxx: this is an indicator of frequency-of-use ranking in the
	wordfreq file. "xx" is the number of the set of 500 words in which
	the entry can be found, with "01" assigned to the first 500, "02"
	to the second, and so on. (The entries with news1, ichi1, spec1 and 
	gai1 values are marked with a "(P)" in the EDICT and EDICT2
	files.)

	The reason both the kanji and reading elements are tagged is because 
	on occasions a priority is only associated with a particular
	kanji/reading pair.

<!ELEMENT r_ele (reb, re_nokanji?, re_restr*, re_inf*, re_pri*)>
	<!-- The reading element typically contains the valid readings
	of the word(s) in the kanji element using modern kanadzukai. 
	Where there are multiple reading elements, they will typically be
	alternative readings of the kanji element. In the absence of a 
	kanji element, i.e. in the case of a word or phrase written
	entirely in kana, these elements will define the entry.

<!ELEMENT reb (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- this element content is restricted to kana and related

	-->
<!ELEMENT re_nokanji (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- This element, which will usually have a null value, indicates
	that the reb, while associated with the keb, cannot be regarded
	as a true reading of the kanji. It is typically used for words
	such as foreign place names, gairaigo which can be in kanji or
	katakana, etc.
	-->
<!ELEMENT re_restr (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- This element is used to indicate when the reading only applies
	to a subset of the keb elements in the entry. In its absence, all

	must exactly match those of one of the keb elements.

<!ELEMENT xref (#PCDATA)*>
	<!-- This element is used to indicate a cross-reference to another
	entry with a similar or related meaning or sense. The content of
	this element is typically a keb or reb element in another entry. In some
	cases a keb will be followed by a reb and/or a sense number to provide
	a precise target for the cross-reference. Where this happens, a JIS
	"centre-dot" (0x2126) is placed between the components of the 
	cross-reference.

<!ELEMENT ant (#PCDATA)*>
	<!-- This element is used to indicate another entry which is an

<!ELEMENT pos (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- Part-of-speech information about the entry/sense. Should use 
	appropriate entity codes. In general where there are multiple senses
	in an entry, the part-of-speech of an earlier sense will apply to

<!ELEMENT lsource (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- This element records the information about the source
	language(s) of a loan-word/gairaigo. If the source language is other 
	than English, the language is indicated by the xml:lang attribute.
	The element value (if any) is the source word or phrase.

	<!-- The xml:lang attribute defines the language(s) from which
	a loanword is drawn.  It will be coded using the three-letter language 
	code from the ISO 639-2 standard. When absent, the value "eng" (i.e. 
	English) is the default value. The bibliographic (B) codes are used. -->
<!ATTLIST lsource ls_type CDATA #IMPLIED>
	<!-- The ls_type attribute indicates whether the lsource element
	fully or partially describes the source word or phrase of the
	loanword. If absent, it will have the implied value of "full".

<!ELEMENT gloss (#PCDATA | pri)*>

	may be omitted in entries which are purely for a cross-reference.
